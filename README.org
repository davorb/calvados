Calvados is a daemon for automatically adjusting the display
brightness on a laptop. It is similar to [[https://github.com/Janhouse/lighter][Lighter]] and [[https://github.com/poliva/lightum][Lightum]], with the
difference that it uses no external dependencies and requires less
resources to run.

* Harware Support
  The current version is written explicitly for a MacBook Pro
  (late 2011) model, running Arch Linux. Adding support for other
  hardware is considered trivial.

* Compiling from source
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./configure
  make
#+END_SRC

* Starting the daemon
  The program will require explicit permission to change the display
  brightness levels, and read the ambient brightness sensor. The
  easiest way to accomplish this is by running it as root.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo ./src/calvados
  #+END_SRC
